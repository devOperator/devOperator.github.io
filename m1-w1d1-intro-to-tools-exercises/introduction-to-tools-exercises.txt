Introduction to Tools Exercises
-------------------------------

The following exercises cover Git, and several Unix commands typically used
alongside Git. They are intended to help you gain familiarity and build 
confidence while on the command line inside the Terminal.

The exercise folder contains this file, plus a java-helloworld folder.  The
java-helloworld folder represents a simplified Java project. (The layout of an
actual Java project will be covered in later lectures.) For now, the reduced 
structure provides an opportunity to navigate between folders, and to work with
files as you would in an actual Java project, but cleared of much of the 
clutter found in real projects.


----
1.  To begin, open your terminal, and enter the following command to change 
    directory to the exercise folder.
----

$ cd ~/workspace/exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/

Note, do not enter the beginning "$" character. It represents the prompt for 
the command line. This convention is commonly used to visually separate the 
actual command from other text in Unix documentation.


----
2.  What does the ~ (tilde) character in the above command to change directory 
    refer to?
----

The tilde changes the directory that is used in the following command to the home directory
So that the home directory is used as the starting point for whatever follows
it in the command.

----
3.  A good habit to develop, especially while you're developing your skills on 
    the command line, is to confirm your location after changing directories. 
    This can be easily accomplished with the "pwd" command.


----

$ pwd

Techs-MacBook-Air:m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises cbrown$ pwd
/Users/cbrown/cameronbrown-java-exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises

The present working directory displayed should match the directory you changed 
to in Exercise 1.  Note, the two may not match at the very beginning if you
used the tilde when changing directories.  The tilde is a conveniece to save 
you some typing.  The system resolves the tilde to the full location as it
changes directory, and the "pwd" command reflects this.


----
4.  Display a list of all the files and folders in your present working 
    directory. Include all dot-files and dot-folders.  Recall the "all" and
    "long format" flags for the "ls" command.
----

----
5.  What do the "." and ".." folders displayed in the directory listing in
    Exercise 4 represent?
----

<".." represents the parent directory, "." represents the current directory>

----
6.  What are the names of the files, including any dot-files, displayed in the
    directory listing in Exercise 4?
----

Introduction-to-tools-exercises.txt


----
7.  What are the names of the folders, including any dot-folders, displayed in 
    the directory listing in Exercise 4?


----

<Helloworld, m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises, cameronbrown-java-exercises>

----
8.  pom.xml is a Maven build file. You will learn more about Maven in later 
    lectures. As for the exercise, it is sometimes necessary, and usually 
    always interesting to be able to view the contents of files while at the
    command line. A friendly and easy-to-use utility that allows you to do this
    is "less".  
    
    "less" has two great features. First, it is a file viewer. You never have 
    to worry about accidently modifying the file, as you would if you opened it 
    in an editor.  Second, it allows you to page-up, page-down, search, and 
    perform other nifty navigations which are really useful when files are big.

    View pom.xml using "less".  

    Or, for the more adventuresome, you might want to try using "less" with a huge
    file like database/pagila.sql where the utility's navigation features really
    shine.

    Press Q to quit when you wish to stop viewing either of the files.
----

$ less pom.xml

Or

$ less database/pagila.sql

You are encouraged to make "less" part of your standard command line toolkit.


----
9.  This is good time to make a Git snapshot of your progress.  Usually, 
    you'll want to check the Git status to review the list of files that
    have been changed, added, or deleted.  Then you'll want to add and commit
    those changes to your local repository.

    Don't forget to save your current changes to this text file to disk before
    making the snapshot.
----

Did you remember to save "m1-introduction-to-tools-exercise.txt"?

Techs-MacBook-Air:m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises cbrown$ git status

nothing to commit, working tree clean

Note, you do not need to push this commit up to BitBucket. The typical Git 
workflow is to many small commits to your local repo, with pushes up to 
BitBucket when a feature, fix, or in this case, assignment is finished.  


----
10.  Change into src/main/java/com/techelevator directory under java-helloworld.
    Show your present working directory after the change.
----

$ cd src/main/java/com/techelevator
$ <enter command to display present working directory>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:techelevator cbrown$ pwd
/Users/cbrown/cameronbrown-java-exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/java-helloworld/src/main/java/com/techelevator>


----
11. Does the change directory command in Exercise 9 use a relative, or absolute
    path?
----

<Relative Path, as the command did not start with />


----
12. List all the files and folders, including any dot-files or dot-folders in
    your present working directory.



----

$ <enter command to list all files and folders including dot-files and dot-folders>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:techelevator cbrown$ ls -la

----
13. "Helloworld.java" is the sole source code file of the Helloworld application.
    Make a backup of the file named "Helloworld.java.backup" using the copy 
    command.
----

$ cp Helloworld.java Helloworld.java.backup

The "cp" parameters are the name of the source file followed by the name of the 
destination file. 

$ <enter command to list all files and folders in order to confirm the creation of the backup file>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:techelevator cbrown$ ls
Helloworld.java		Helloworld.java.backup>


----    
14. Rename "Helloworld.java.backup" to "Helloworld.java.copy" using the move 
    command. (There is no rename command in UNIX.)
----

$ mv Helloworld.java.backup Helloworld.java.copy

The "mv" parameters are the existing name of the file followed by the new name 
of the file. 

$ <enter command to list all files and folders in order to confirm the renaming of the file>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:techelevator cbrown$ ls
Helloworld.java		Helloworld.java.copy>


----
15. Let's call this a "feature completion" point in the exercises, and not only
    checkin to the local repository, but also push it up to BitBucket. 
----

----
16. Delete the backup file, "Helloworld.java.copy" using the remove command.
----

$ rm Helloworld.java.copy

The "rm" parameter is the name of the file to be deleted.

$ <enter command to list all files and folders in order to confirm the file deletion>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:techelevator cbrown$ ls
Helloworld.java>


----
17. Change directory to the java-helloworld folder using either one of the 
    commands shown below.
----

$ cd ../../../../../

or

$ cd ~/workspace/exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/java-helloworld

Note the first alternative relies upon the ".." parent folder notation.  In 
essence it says to change directory from the current folder's parent's parent's
parent's parent's parent.  You'll know you're getting comfortable at the
command line when that seems natural.

Regardless of the option you chose, check your new location.

$ <enter command to display present working directory>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:java-helloworld cbrown$ pwd
/Users/cbrown/cameronbrown-java-exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/java-helloworld>


----
18. Create a documentation folder named "docs" under java-helloworld, and then
    change into it.
----

$ mkdir docs
$ <enter the command to change directory to "docs" using a relative path>
$ <enter command to display present working directory>
<Techs-MacBook-Air:docs cbrown$ pwd
/Users/cbrown/cameronbrown-java-exercises/m1-w1d1-intro-to-tools-exercises/java-helloworld/docs>

----
19. Create a new file name "readme.txt" using Visual Studio Code, and add the text
    "Hello, this is the beginning of the application's documentation."
----

$ code readme.txt

Don't forget to save the file in Visual Studio Code!


----
20. As a final exercise, please perform the following commands to save and push your 
    work so it can be reviewed by an instructor.
----

$ <enter the Git command to display status>

$ <enter the Git command to "stage" all changes>

$ <enter the Git command to save all "staged" changes>

$ <enter the Git command to save local repository to BitBucket>
