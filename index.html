    <h2> Energy </h2>
    <p> Everybody consumes it yet there are very few large players in this industry.
        With the frequent crashes in oil markets every decade or so this is one area
        where the true value investor can shine. High dividend yields are the norm here
        as growth is limited. Even for those seeking high growth opportunities the 
        cash flow offered can be hard to pass up.

    <h2> Consumer Packaged Goods </h2>


  <p> Strong brand names and in many cases high margins make this arena great for 
      building generational wealth. The names your mother used in the kitchen are likely
      in your kitchen as well. These brands stick and so do the profits.

    <h2> Pharmaceuticals  </h2>

    <p> The margins here are staggering and the market is growing as the population
        increases in size and in age. This market has traditionally been high on 
        the list for the durability of it's earnings as well as for it's high ROE.

    <h2>Data Companies </h2>
 
  
  <p> Here is a new one. To make the case for the big data industry just 
      look at the user count for some of the giants in the social media space.
      The amount of data collected by these companies is invaluable to corporations
      especially as tv subscriptions dwindle. They have to spend those ad dollars 
      somewhere. Some sources have been significantly undervalued and showing great
      upside potential.
